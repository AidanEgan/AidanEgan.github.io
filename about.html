      <div class="card-body">
          I am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Villanova University, with a
          minor in Engineering and Entrepreneurship. At Villanova I have been able to foster
          my skills as a programmer, broadening my algorithmic thinking skills through the programming
          team and collaborating with others on group projects. Furthmore, I have had opportunities to
          develop my communication and critical thinking skills, applying them in both work and classroom settings.

      <div class="card-header"><b>Work Experience:</b></div>
      <div class="card-body">
          This past summer, I participated in a cybersecurity REU through Oakland University. Here, I assisted a research
          team by investigating the security of a machine-learning based programming infrastructure they seek to develop.
          Through this experience, I not only mangaged to participate in research on the forefront of cybersecurity as a field,
          but I also learned a great deal about compiler/language design, common machine learning algorithms, and the use
          of cloud services such as Amazon's AWS.
          <br /><br />
          At Villanova, I also work as a teaching assistant for the Analysis of Algorithms course, and work for the
          University IT department as a technician. In these positions, I have ample opportunity to work on my interpersonal skills
          and develop my technical understanding of everything from algorithm design to computer hardware.

      <div class="card-header"><b>Interests & Projects:</b></div>
      <div class="card-body">
          I am passionate about numerous aspects of computer science including mobile/web development, machine learning, and
          cybersecurity. I find that all of these fields are developing in interesting ways, and often the intersections of these
          fields provide opportunity for exciting developments and insights. I am primarily interested in Python and JavaScript
          projects, but I have experience with other langauges as well such as Java and C.
          <br/><br/>
          Currently, I am working on a project in Python that aims to transform an image using English-based instructions
          given by a user. This project provides me opportunities to investigate artificial intelligence techniques such as natural
          language processing to create this useful tool. Aside from this, I have also worked on other projects involving different
          fields of software engineering. This includes a file upload server written in Python and Flask, a Chrome Extension that
          searches for all links on a current page, and an Android application used to track one's progress at the gym.
          <br/><br/>
          This website was primarily written with standard html/css/javascript, but incorporates a few tools and technologies. It makes
          use of bootstrap along with a theme called <a href="https://bootswatch.com/zephyr"><u>zephyr</u></a>, this
          <a href="https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me"><u>weather api</u></a>, and the button was created as a react element.
